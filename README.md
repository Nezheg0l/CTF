# 🧠 CTF Writeups & Exploits

My personal journal with CTF, TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and private challenges.  
The goal is not just to “pass,” but to **deeply understand exploitation**, both as an attacker and as a defender.

## 📚 Categories:
- 🔥 Web Exploitation (XSS, SQLi, RCE, very many)
- 🧱 Binary Exploitation (BOF, Format Strings, Ret2libc)
- 🧠 Reverse Engineering
- 🌐 Network & Protocol Analysis
- 💣 Privilege Escalation
- 🔍 OSINT & Recon
