# PortSwigger Academy: SQL Injection Labs

Welcome to my repository of solved SQL Injection labs from the PortSwigger Web Security Academy. This directory serves as a detailed log of my journey, documenting the techniques, payloads, and methodologies I used to tackle each challenge.

The goal is not just to find the flag, but to understand the vulnerability at its core. Each entry links to a detailed write-up.

## üöÄ Completed Labs

Here is a list of the labs I have successfully completed (Practitioner level and above). Each one includes a link to the detailed write-up.

| Lab Title                                                                                               | Difficulty   | Key Technique Explored                               |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| [SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle](https://github.com/Nezheg0l/CTF/tree/main/PortSwigger/SQL-INJECT/querying%20the%20database%20Oracle/Readme.md)| `PRACTITIONERüü©` | `UNION` attack, retrieving version strings from `v$version`. |
| [SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft](https://github.com/Nezheg0l/CTF/blob/main/PortSwigger/SQL-INJECT/querying%20the%20database%20MySQL%20and%20Microsoft/Readme.md)                                  | `PRACTITIONERüü©` | `UNION` attack, retrieving version strings from `@@version`. |
| [SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases](https://github.com/Nezheg0l/CTF/blob/main/PortSwigger/SQL-INJECT/listing%20the%20database%20on%20non-Oracle%20databases/Readme.md)                                  | `PRACTITIONERüü©` | `UNION` attack, retrieving user and pass strings from `information_schema.tables`. |

### How to Navigate
Each lab has its own dedicated directory. Inside, you'll find a `README.md` file that contains a comprehensive write-up covering:
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** A breakdown of why the vulnerability exists.
*   **Exploitation Steps:** The step-by-step process of exploiting the flaw.
*   **Payloads:** The exact payloads used, with explanations.
*   **Mitigation:** A brief on how to prevent such vulnerabilities.

## ‚öîÔ∏è My Philosophy

"The best way to learn defense is to master the offense. To protect a system, you must first understand how to break it."

This repository is a testament to that belief. It's a continuous effort to sharpen my skills, dive deep into vulnerabilities, and think like an attacker to ultimately build more secure systems.
